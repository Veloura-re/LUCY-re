# Master Assessment Creation Guide

Developing high-fidelity assessments in LUCY is designed to be as fluid as writing in a document. You can create exams manually, via AI transcription, or by scanning physical papers.

### 1. Accessing the Command Center
1. Navigate to your **Teacher Dashboard**.
2. Select **Exams / Assessments**.
3. Locate your exam and click the **Gear / Edit icon** to enter the **Neural Editor**.

### 2. Manual Creation
- Use the **(+) Plus Button** on the floating toolbar to add a new question node.
- **Switch Types**: Use the tabs on any question block to toggle between:
    - **MCQ**: Standard multiple choice.
    - **Short Answer**: Keyword-based exact matching.
    - **Essay (Long)**: AI-evaluated responses using a custom rubric.
    - **True / False**: Boolean logic questions.
- **Set Points**: Adjust point values in the top-left of each question block.

### 3. Neural Write (AI Transcription)
If you have a rough draft in a Word doc or notepad:
1. Click the **Neural Write (File icon)** on the toolbar.
2. Paste your "normal writing" draft. (e.g., *"Create 3 MCQs about gravity and a 50-word essay on orbits."*)
3. Click **Begin Transcription**. The AI will synthesize your text into structured, gradable nodes instantly.

### 4. Scan Paper (OCR)
To digitize physical exam papers:
1. Click the **Scan Paper (Image icon)** on the toolbar.
2. Upload or snap a photo of the physical assessment.
3. The system will use Computer Vision to extract text and structure it into your digital editor.

### 5. Neural Remixing (Anti-Cheating)
To prevent academic dishonesty across multiple class sessions:
1. Click the **Sparkles (Remix)** button on the toolbar.
2. The AI will analyze your existing questions and generate **unique variations** that test the same knowledge but with different wording or values.

### 6. Publishing & Grading
1. Once satisfied, click **Publish Update** in the top header.
2. Students can now access the **Exam Room** to submit their answers.
3. After submission, navigate to the **Gradebook** to audit the AI-generated scores and publish final marks.
